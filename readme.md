This is a scraping project to warm up in bash. Since sundaeswap hasn't api to get updated prices, let's do something useful :)

## Instrucitons :
place yourself into the root of the __project directory__, then start the program on `Linux` (you will need `apt`) or `MacOS` with the following command :
```
./scrape.sh
```
or
```
bash scrape.sh
```
